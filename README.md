# Customer_churn_prediction
What is customer churn prediction?
Customer churn prediction refers to the process of using data and analytics to predict which customers are likely to stop using a company's product or service over a specific period of time. Churn, in this context, means when a customer discontinues their relationship with a business, whether by canceling a subscription, switching to a competitor, or simply ceasing to engage with the product or service.

**Overview**
This project aims to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service using historical customer data. By analyzing factors like usage patterns, demographic details, and financial attributes, we build a machine-learning model to identify customers likely to leave.

**Dataset**
The dataset consists of various customer details, including:
RowNumber
CustomerId
Surname
CreditScore
Geography
Gender
Age
Tenure
Balance
NumOfProducts
HasCrCard
IsActiveMember
EstimatedSalary
Exited

**Objective**
The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts churn and helps businesses take proactive measures to retain customers.

Project Workflow
**1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
Handle missing values
Convert categorical variables
Normalize numerical features

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Visualizing churn distribution
Understanding correlations between features
Identifying key churn indicators

**3. Feature Engineering**
Selecting relevant features
Handling imbalanced data

**4. Model Training & Evaluation**
Training multiple models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
Evaluating performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

**5. Predictions & Insights**
Identifying top factors influencing churn
Making predictions on new customer data


**Technologies Used**
Python
Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
VS code(Jupyter Notebook)
